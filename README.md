This package defines:
* `AbstractInterval`, along with its subtypes:
  * `Interval{T,L,R}`, which represents a non-iterable range between two endpoints of type `T`
    with left/right bounds types respectively being `L` and `R`
  * `AnchoredInterval{P,T,L,R}`, which represents a non-iterable range defined by a single
    value `anchor::T` and the value type `P` which represents the span of the range. Left/right bounds types are specifed
    by `L` and `R` respectively
    * `HourEnding`, a type alias for `AnchoredInterval{Hour(-1)}`
    * `HourBeginning`, a type alias for `AnchoredInterval{Hour(1)}`
    * `HE` and `HB`, pseudoconstructors for `HourEnding` and `HourBeginning` that round the
      anchor up (`HE`) or down (`HB`) to the nearest hour
* `Bound`, abstract type for all possible bounds type classifications:
  * `Closed`, indicating the endpoint value of the interval is included
  * `Open`, indicating the endpoint value of the interval is not included
  * `Unbounded`, indicating the endpoint value is effectively infinite
