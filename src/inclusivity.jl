"""
    Inclusivity(i::Integer) -> Inclusivity

Defines whether an interval is open, half-open, or closed, using an integer code:

### Inclusivity Values

* `0`: Neither endpoint is included (the `AbstractInterval` is open)
* `1`: Only the lesser endpoint is included (the `AbstractInterval` is left-closed)
* `2`: Only the greater endpoint is included (the `AbstractInterval` is right-closed)
* `3`: Both endpoints are included (the `AbstractInterval` is closed)

Note that this constructor does not perform bounds-checking: instead it checks the values
of the two least-significant bits of the integer. This means that `Inclusivity(5)` is
equivalent to `Inclusivity(1)`.
